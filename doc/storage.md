# Storage

*Since YMMV, this doc is more general than most. It contains basic procedures to manage filesystems relevant to GHost (XFS, Btrfs, and ZFS) in a number of ways including software RAID.*

## What you need to know

- (optional) If you need to group **multiple drives**, *first* create an [array](#arrays).
- A physical drive must be **formatted** using a [filesystem](#filesystem).
- A formatted filesystem must finally be [mounted](#mount) to **read/write** it.

For [ZFS](#zfs) and [Btrfs](#btrfs), these principles stand, but head over to their dedicated section as they manage things their own way.

> [!Note]
> In this doc, we manage a hypothetical storage subsystem called `data`, located at `/mnt/data`.




## Mount

ðŸ“˜`man`: [`mount`][man-mount]

Canonical form: `mount [-fnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-o options] device mountpoint`



### Basic use

A formatted device can be mounted to a directory using `mount` as superuser.

```bash
sudo mount -vm /dev/md0 /mnt/data
```

> [!Tip]
> `-m` (`--mkdir`) creates the mount point directory if it does not exist yet.

### `fstab` (boot mount)

Get the UUID of the device:

```bash
sudo blkid | grep /dev/<your-device>
```

Edit `/etc/fstab` to add an entry for the RAID 0 array:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add this line (replace `UUID` with the actual UUID from the `blkid` command):

```fstab
UUID=<your-uuid> /mnt/data xfs defaults,noatime 0 0
```













## Filesystem

[XFS](#xfs) (or even Ext4) is fine for most cases.

If you have special needs:
- consider [ZFS](#zfs) (raid z is great),
- then [Btrfs](#btrfs) (but **NEVER** in raid 5 or 6).  

*[Bcachefs](https://bcachefs.org/) looks promising but is too new in my opinion.*




### XFS

ðŸ“˜`man`: [`xfs`][man-xfs], [`mkfs.xfs`][man-mkfs.xfs]



#### Create the XFS filesystem

Format the device with the XFS filesystem.  
*Here we use a RAID device `/dev/md0` previously created with [`mdadm`](#mdadm).*

```bash
sudo mkfs.xfs -L data /dev/md0
```











### ZFS










### Btrfs

> [!Caution]
> **NEVER use RAID 5 or 6 with Btrfs!**  
> It's ***fundamentally* broken**.

















## Arrays

Create the `mdadm` array first, except for ZFS and Btrfs which feature built-in device management.



### `mdadm`

`mdadm` *(**m**ultiple **d**evices **adm**inistration) lets us "merge" storage devices in RAID arrays, which are then seen (and formatted) as one virtual device (for increased higher size, reliability and/or performance).*

ðŸ“˜`man`: [`mdadm`][man-mdadm]

Canonical command: `mdadm [mode] <raiddevice> [options] <component-devices>`



#### Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mdadm
```

#### Create array

Example RAID 0 over 3 devices:

```bash
sudo mdadm -Cv /dev/md0 -l0 -n3 \
/dev/nvme-xxx \
/dev/nvme-xxx \
/dev/nvme-xxx
```

- `-C` = `--create` \[mode\]
- `-v` = `--verbose`
- `/dev/md0` is the name of the new RAID device.
- `-l0` = `--level=0` specifies the RAID level of the array.  
  (Options are: `linear`, `raid0` | `0` | `stripe`, `raid1` | `1` | `mirror`, `raid4` | `4`, `raid5` | `5`, `raid6` | `6`, `raid10` | `10`, `multipath` | `mp`, `faulty`, `container`; obviously some of these are synonymous).
- `-n3` = `--raid-devices=3` tells how many drives to use for the array.
- End with the list of devices.

Check the creation of the RAID array:

```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```

And further inspect the RAID:

```bash
sudo mdadm --detail -vv /dev/md0
```
