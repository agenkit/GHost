# Setup Guide (basic)

## 1 ¬∑¬∑¬∑ Host OS installation

*Two approaches for the host GUI: 'richer' (KDE, Gnome...) or 'leaner' (Mate, i3...).  
Here we go with KDE on Ubuntu, because it has many required features out of the box.*

> [!Note]
> This host OS, though perfectly usable as a workstation, will eventually operate as the lowest layer (the "hypervisor") in our single-PC virtualized infrastructure. It will sit 'underneath it all' from the standpoint of our ultimate virtual workstation. We give it GUI capabilities because it's cheap (integrated in most consumer CPUs), convenient for setup and use (as you're experiencing right now), and actually harder to avoid than not on consumer platform, whose default specs are optimized for workstation/desktop use as opposed to server (no dumb VGA or serial outputs, or adapters & devices to leverage those).  
> If you use a Epyc, Thunderbolt, or Xeon platform, YMMV; consider doing the hypervisor as a pure 'headless' server.




### Make a bootable device

1. Download the **Kubuntu [`.iso üîΩ`](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/24.04/release/kubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso)** file.

1. Download the latest **Balena Etcher [release](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases)** for your *current* OS (where you will flash the `.iso` to USB).

1. Install Etcher.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./balena-etcher_******_amd64.deb
   ```

1. Launch it (GUI üñ±Ô∏è app in your usual menu).

1. Flash `kubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso` onto your USB stick.

1. Shutdown the PC.




### Install Linux

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unplug (physically) all video outputs, except the host's.**

   *In this guide, the Ryzen iGPU is dedicated to the host.  
   So we unplug all video cables going out of the Nvidia GPU.*[^unplug]

1. Boot to USB to setup Kubuntu.

1. **Follow the steps** (language, kbd. layout, time zone, network, `$HOST`, `$USERNAME`‚Ä¶)  
until it asks you about **storage**.

1. Choose **Btrfs** for the OS root partition ("`/`").[^btrfs-root]
      
      NOTE: ‚õî **NEVER** use **RAID 5** or **6** with Btrfs, it's **fatally flawed**.  
      All manners of RAID 1 and 0 (1c3, 1c4, 10) are perfectly fine however.
      
1. Agree to install **`virt-manager`** to get the KVM/QEMU stack properly installed.
   
1. Remove the USB stick when asked to, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   You'll reboot on the freshly installed system, to be greeted by the KDE welcome wizard.




### First boot

1. Upgrade packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```




### Shell

1. Install your preferred CLI shell.[^shell]

   *See* **[`Shell`](doc/shell.md)** *for more details.*

1. *(Optional) Play with OS & DE settings to your liking.  
Custom DNS, packages like `htop`, theme, etc.*




### Additional storage

1. **Recommended**: Setup additional devices meant to be used by the host, such as **high-IOPS storage** for VMs, and large fast storage for large static file collections like AI models.

   *It's hard to generalize for all users.*  
    *See* üìú **[Storage](doc/storage.md)** *if needed.*

   *Example: array of n=`3` drives; in RAID level `0`; XFS filesystem named `fs` mounted at `/fs`.*

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mdadm                    # Multiple Devices ADMinistration
   sudo mdadm -Cv /dev/md0 -l0 -n3 $disk{1,2,3}          # Create RAID level 0

   cat /proc/mdstat                                          # Check the array
   sudo mdadm --detail -vv /dev/md03

   sudo mkfs.xfs -L fs /dev/md0                                # Format to XFS

   sudo mount -mo defaults,noatime,logbsize=256k /dev/md0 /fs       # Mount it
   ```

   *To setup boot mount, get the UUID‚Ä¶*

   ```bash
   sudo blkid | grep md0
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   *‚Ä¶ and add it to `fstab`.*

   ```
   UUID=<your-uuid> /fs xfs defaults,noatime,logbsize=256k 0 0
   ```
   



### Browser

1. *(Optional) Install your browser of choice (I use [Brave](https://brave.com/linux/#debian-ubuntu-mint)).*  
  *Instructions as of Sept. 2024:*

   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl

   sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main"|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install brave-browser
   ```










## ¬∑2¬∑ Security




### Secrets

1. Setup whatever means you use to **store and access secrets**.  
   *Software, pen and paper, savant memory‚Ä¶ it's up to you.*[^secrets]

1. Fill in all **credentials for this workstation**. User password, any filesystem encryption passphrase, browser sync, etc.




### Firewall

**`ufw`**, the **U**ncomplicated **F**ire**w**all,[^ufw] is preinstalled with Ubuntu.

GUI setup:

1. Open the Settings > **Firewall** app  

1. Tick the top box to **enable** it.

1. Check that "Default **Incoming** Policy" is set to **`Ignore`**.

1. Check that "Default **Outgoing** Policy" is set to **`Allow`**.

[CLI setup](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/security/firewalls/):

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```




### SSH server

1. Install OpenSSH.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install sshd
   ```

1. Setup the config file.

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/sshd/
   ```

1.
