## 1 ‚Äî Host OS installation

*Two approaches for the host GUI: 'richer' (KDE, Gnome...) or 'leaner' (Mate, i3...).  
Here we go with KDE on Ubuntu, because it has many required features out of the box.*

> [!Note]
> This host OS, though perfectly usable as a workstation, will eventually operate as the lowest layer (the "hypervisor") in our single-PC virtualized infrastructure. It will sit 'underneath it all' from the standpoint of our ultimate virtual workstation. We give it GUI capabilities because it's cheap (integrated in most consumer CPUs), convenient for setup and use (as you're experiencing right now), and actually harder to avoid than not on consumer platform, whose default specs are optimized for workstation/desktop use as opposed to server (no dumb VGA or serial outputs, or adapters & devices to leverage those).  
> If you use a Epyc, Thunderbolt, or Xeon platform, YMMV; consider doing the hypervisor as a pure 'headless' server.




### Make a bootable device

1. Download the **Kubuntu [`.iso üîΩ`](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/24.04/release/kubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso)** file.

1. Download the latest **Balena Etcher [release](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases)** for your *current* OS (where you will flash the `.iso` to USB).

1. Install Etcher.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./balena-etcher_******_amd64.deb
   ```

1. Launch it (GUI üñ±Ô∏è app in your usual menu).

1. Flash `kubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso` onto your USB stick.

1. Shutdown the PC.




### Install Linux

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unplug (physically) all video outputs, except the host's.**

   *In this guide, the Ryzen iGPU is dedicated to the host.  
   So we unplug all video cables going out of the Nvidia GPU.*[^unplug]

1. Boot to USB to setup Kubuntu.

1. **Follow the steps** (language, kbd. layout, time zone, network, `$HOST`, `$USERNAME`‚Ä¶)  
until it asks you about **storage**.

1. Choose **Btrfs** for the OS root partition ("`/`").[^btrfs-root]
      
      NOTE: ‚õî **NEVER** use **RAID 5** or **6** with Btrfs, it's **fatally flawed**.  
      All manners of RAID 1 and 0 (1c3, 1c4, 10) are perfectly fine however.
      
1. Agree to install **`virt-manager`** to get the KVM/QEMU stack properly installed.
   
1. Remove the USB stick when asked to, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   You'll reboot on the freshly installed system, to be greeted by the KDE welcome wizard.




## Host OS configuration




### First boot

1. Upgrade packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

1. Open KDE Settings.

   1. Ensure **Display** is fine (Xorg|Wayland; resolution, refresh rate, scaling; **Fonts**, antialiasing‚Ä¶)  
   *Reboot if needed.*

   1. Check the **Driver Manager** for your currently in-use GPU otherwise.
   
   1. Do stuff needed for you (appearance, behaviors, shortcuts, Bluetooth, etc.)




### Shell

1. Install your preferred **CLI shell**.[^shell]

   *Suggestion:* [**Zsh**](https://github.com/agenkit/GHost/blob/main/doc/shell.md#zsh)  
   *It's easier for admin duties; allows advanced scripting (like Perl); transfers to BSD (including MacOS).*  
   *See* **[`Shell`](doc/shell.md)** *for more details.*

1. *(Optional) Play with OS & DE settings to your liking.  
Custom DNS; nice packages like `htop`, `batcat`, `tldr`; themes, etc.*




### Additional storage

**Recommended**: Setup additional devices meant to be used by the host, such as **high-IOPS storage** for VMs, and large fast storage for large static file collections like AI models.

It's hard to generalize for all users.  
See üìú **[Storage](doc/storage.md)** if needed.

Example:
   - *array of n=*`3` *drives*
   - *RAID level* `0`
   - *XFS filesystem label* `fs`
   - *mounted at* `/fs`

Disk names should be sourced from `/dev/disk/by-id/`  
ü°¢ select those with a unique **serial_number** or `eui`

1. Install `mdadm` (**m**ultiple **d**evices **adm**inistration).

   ```sh
   sudo apt install mdadm
   ```

1. Create RAID level 0 virtual DEVice 'md0' with 3 disks.

   ```sh
   sudo mdadm -Cv /dev/md0 -l0 -n3 \
   /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Samsung_SSD_XXX_PRO_1TB_<serial_number> \
   /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Samsung_SSD_XXX_PRO_1TB_<serial_number> \
   /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-Samsung_SSD_XXX_PRO_1TB_<serial_number>
   ```

1. Check the array.

   ```sh
   cat /proc/mdstat
   sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0
   ```

1. Format to XFS.

   ```sh
   sudo mkfs.xfs -L fs /dev/md0
   ```

1. Mount the RAID virtual device to a newly created (-m = mkdir) directory '/fs' .

   ```sh
   sudo mount -mo defaults,noatime,logbsize=256k /dev/md0 /fs
   ```

1. Then to setup boot mount, get the RAID virtual device UUID‚Ä¶

   ```sh
   sudo blkid | grep md0
   ```

   > ü°≥ *output* 
   >
   > ```
   > /dev/md0: LABEL="fs" UUID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="xfs"
   >                            ü°°                                  ü°°
   >                            This is the part you want.
   > ```

1. Copy your UUID number.

1. Open `fstab`.

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```
   
1. Add this line, presumably last.

   ```
   UUID=<your UUID number> /fs xfs defaults,noatime,logbsize=256k 0 0
   ```

1. **Reboot** to check that it works.  

> [!Warning]
> After reboot, the `mdadm` RAID virtual device MAY have a different name, e.g. to `md127` instead of `md0`.




### Browser

1. *(Optional) Install your browser of choice (I use [Brave](https://brave.com/linux/#debian-ubuntu-mint)).*  
  *Instructions as of Sept. 2024:*

   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl

   sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main"|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install brave-browser
   ```










## 2 ‚Äî Security




### Secrets

1. Setup whatever means you use to **store and access secrets**.  
   *Software, pen and paper, savant memory‚Ä¶ it's up to you.*[^secrets]

1. Fill in all **credentials for this workstation**. User password, any filesystem encryption passphrase, browser sync, etc.




### Firewall

**`ufw`**, the **U**ncomplicated **F**ire**w**all,[^ufw] is preinstalled with Ubuntu.

GUI setup:

1. Open the Settings > **Firewall** app  

1. Tick the top box to **enable** it.

1. Check that "Default **Incoming** Policy" is set to **`Ignore`**.

1. Check that "Default **Outgoing** Policy" is set to **`Allow`**.

[CLI setup](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/security/firewalls/):

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```




### SSH server

1. Install OpenSSH.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install sshd
   ```

1. Setup the config file.

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/sshd/
   ```

1. 










## 3 ‚Äî IOMMU

From this point on, we mostly rely on Bryan Steiner's excellent [tutorial](https://github.com/bryansteiner/gpu-passthrough-tutorial/).

## Libvirt hooks

## VM (1) creation

## Performance tweaks
